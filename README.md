# FliprHackathon

This repo is made for the Flipr Hackathon Hiring Program 4.0
The track chosen by me was Machine Learning, and the question was related to COVID-19

This repo contains, the solution document along with 2 excel sheets which contain answers for the 2 questions

It also contains 2 jupyter notebook files.
The first question is solved using an Artificial Neural Network to predict the probabilities in the test_dataset.
The second question includes an LSTM Time Series Model to predict the Diuresis Values and then subsequently uses the same model as the first question
